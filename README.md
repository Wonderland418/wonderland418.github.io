## About Me

Born in the blue age of Millennium Mambo, 
in the year the clocks reset.  
Floating between physics and poetry, 
wondering between logic and longing,  
in rhythm with order, in the silence of entropy.

Care for a cup of Oriental Beauty—sweet enough to make you forget your name？

生於千禧曼波的藍色時代，在時鐘歸零之年。  
漂浮於物理與詩意之中，夢遊於邏輯與渴望之間,  
共振於秩序之中，淡泊於熵值之間。

來杯東方美人茶嗎？
